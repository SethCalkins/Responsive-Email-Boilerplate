Responsive-Email-Boilerplate
============================

A responsive email template to jumpstart your next HTML email project. It uses many of the tips, tricks and hacks developed by the email giants (MailChimp, CampaignMonitor, Email on Acid) and countless others. Without these pioneers this template wouldn't be possible :)

**Features**

* Several common design patterns - Full-width responsive header image, 2-column image sections which stack left-on-right and right-on-left, 2-column text sections and full-width text section.
* Gmail App autofit killer - A placeholder image that prevents Gmail from 'autofitting' the email and destroying your beautiful responsive layout. 

**How To Use**

This boilerplate is meant to be a starting point. After you make your customizations, but before sending the email, you should follow all the standard HTML email best practices. If you're using an ESP like MailChimp the CSS will be automatically inlined. If you're sending this email yourself you should run it through a <a href="http://beaker.mailchimp.com/inline-css">CSS inliner</a>.

**Roadmap**

This is an extremely early version and will likely change in the future.
