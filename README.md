Responsive-Email-Boilerplate
============================

A responsive email template to jumpstart your next HTML email project. It uses many of the tips, tricks and hacks developed by the email giants (MailChimp, CampaignMonitor, Email on Acid) and countless others. Without these pioneers this template wouldn't be possible :)

**Features**

* 2-Column Layout - 2 examples of side-by-side images which collapse on mobile to the right image is positioned either below OR below the left image. 
* Gmail App autofit killer - A placeholder image that prevents Gmail from 'autofitting' the email and destroying your beautiful responsive layout. 

**Roadmap**

This is an extremely early version and will likely change in the near future. Use at your own risk and test frequently.
