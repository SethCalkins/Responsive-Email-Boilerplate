Responsive-Email-Boilerplate
============================

A responsive email template to jumpstart your next HTML email project. It uses many of the tips, tricks and hacks developed by the email giants (MailChimp, CampaignMonitor, Email on Acid) and countless others. Without these pioneers this template wouldn't be possible :)

**Features**

* Several common design patterns - Full-width responsive header image, 2-column image sections which stack left-on-right and right-on-left, 2-column text sections and full-width text section.
* Gmail App autofit killer - A placeholder image that prevents Gmail from 'autofitting' the email and destroying your beautiful responsive layout. 

**Roadmap**

This is an extremely early version and will likely change in the near future. Use at your own risk and test frequently.
